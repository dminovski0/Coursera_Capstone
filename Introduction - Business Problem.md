# Capstone Project - Data Science
## Number of venues in cities in Switzerland and number of venues per population

If you want to visit Switzerland and go to as many places as you can while you are there, this will help you to see which cities have the most venues, and which cities have the most venues per person. This is for travellers and businesspeople alike, and the casual readers will also benefit from the analysis.

This project analyses the total number of venues in some of Switzerland's cities, and the number of venues compared to the population of their respective cities.
